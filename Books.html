    <h5 class="mt-0">Les Misérables</h5>
    <p>The book which the reader now holds in his hands, from one end to the other…treats the advance
    from evil to good, from injustice to justice, from falsity to truth, from darkness to daylight,
    from blind appetite to conscience, from decay to life, from bestiality to duty, from Heaven to Hell,
    from Limbo to God. Matter itself is the starting point, and the point of arrival is the soul.
    Twenty years in the conception and execution, Les Misérables was first published in France and Belgium in 1862,
    a year which found Victor Hugo in exile from his beloved France.</p>

    <h5 class="mt-0">Don Quixote</h5>
    <p>Don Quixote is the most influential work of literature from the Spanish Golden Age and the entire Spanish literary canon.
    As a founding work of modern Western literature, it regularly appears high on lists of the greatest works of fiction ever published,
    such as the Bokklubben World Librarycollection that cites Don Quixote as the authors' choice for the "best literary work ever written".
    The story follows the adventures of a noble (hidalgo) named Alonso Quixano who reads so many chivalric romances
    that he loses his sanity and decides to become a knight-errant (caballero andante), reviving chivalry and serving his country,
    under the name Don Quixote de la Mancha.</p>

    <h5 class="mt-0">The Great Gatsby</h5>
      <p>
    There are many novels which claim that they are the greatest love story of all time.
    It is only in the case of this novel that that statement can be applied and be true.
    The novel is set during the roaring 20s in America, narrated by Nick Carraway,
    a man from a well-to-do family just out of fighting the war and looking to sell bonds. He moves to East Egg,
    the slightly less grand area in comparison to West Egg, right opposite Gatsby's mansion. Gatsby is rich, mega-rich,
    and throws magnificent parties every weekend which the whole town attend. However the host is never seen during these parties,
    and is never completely known by any one person. Gatsby holds a dark secret about his past and how he became so great,
    a deep lust that will eventually lead to his demise.
